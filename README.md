## 📝 Description

GameScope is a web-based platform designed to let users explore detailed game information, create and manage reviews, add comments, and interact with a community-driven review system. Built with a focus on a responsive, dark-themed interface, this app includes a search functionality to quickly find games, making it easy for users to discover and contribute to game content. The project was inspired by the need for a centralized hub to share and discuss game experiences, leveraging Django for robust backend support and custom CSS for a cohesive design.
